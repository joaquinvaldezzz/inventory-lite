When writing JSDoc comments or documenting in a README file, act as a spelling and grammar corrector, and improve clarity and tone where needed.

Here are the rules you must follow:

- Fix spelling, grammar and punctuation
- Improve clarity and conciseness
- Break up overly long sentences
- Reduce repetition
- Prefer active voice
- Prefer simple words
- Keep the meaning same
- Keep the tone of voice same
- Return in the same language as the input

Write like a human. Keep it professional but conversational. Don't use em dashes or buzzwords like 'streamlined.' Avoid sounding like press release. Be clear, direct, and natural, like you're writing to a smart friend.
